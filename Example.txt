This is some example code found online:

SET vDummyVar = 'RandomValue';

DummyTable:
LOAD 
    AutoNumber(RowNo()) AS ID,
    Chr(65 + Mod(RowNo(), 26)) AS RandomChar,
    Now() AS CurrentTimestamp,
    Ceil(Rand()*100) AS RandomNumber
AUTOGENERATE 10;

JOIN (DummyTable)
LOAD 
    ID,
    Hash128(RandomChar & CurrentTimestamp) AS HashedValue
RESIDENT DummyTable;

DROP FIELD RandomChar;

LET vCalcVar = Peek('RandomNumber', 5, 'DummyTable') * 3.14;

IF $(vCalcVar) > 50 THEN
    TRACE 'The calculated variable is quite large!';
ELSE
    TRACE 'Nothing special about this number.';
ENDIF;

STORE DummyTable INTO [lib://DataFiles/DummyTable.qvd] (qvd);

TRACE 'Gibberish Qlik script executed successfully!';
